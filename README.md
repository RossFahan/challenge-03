## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://rossfahan.github.io/password-generator)

This is a simple password generator that generates a password between 8 and 128 characters. The user is prompted through a texdt input field and then can use the genrate password button to start the process of generating a random password. They will be asked to enter the password length, and also what type of characters should be included (lowercase, uppercase, numbers, special characters). The web application checks for proper input, then prints the result to the text field.

The design is also a neat responsive layout.

## Learning Points 


This project mainly tought me how to impement javascript functions, logic, and structure. I also defined an object to store choices regarding the password criteria. I got to learn about javascript methods available, buttons, as well as window prompts and alerts. I also learned some best practices in javascript such as using parseInt() when storing an entered value to a variable meant to hold an integer. 

Another interesting Learning point was figuring out edge cases and how to solve them. The process of structuring out this project gave me a much better insite on how to use functions to encapsulate differnt taks and structure things neatly.
